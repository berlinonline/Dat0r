Prototype for testing a data mapper based on code generation.
The idea is to provide a library that you can use to easily define data structures
along with some features such as structured values, validation and and change tracking.
==============================================================

Installation:
--------------

This library can be used by integrating it via composer.

- add composer: 
curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

- create a 'composer.json' file with the following content:
{
    "require": {
        "shrink/cmf": "*"
    },
    "minimum-stability": "dev"
}

- Then install via composer:
php composer.phar install
