# TODOs

A list of things that could or should be done. Contributions are welcome.

- introduce `hasField()` method on `Module` instead of having to use `getValue()` and catching an `InvalidFieldException`
- fix unspecific documentation in various files (verbose copy&paste docs)
- improve existing validation system/hooks
  - add stable validators
  - maybe reuse Agavi/Symfony validators?
  - validation options instead of new fields with specific validators?
- remove `*Collection` fields?
- more tests
